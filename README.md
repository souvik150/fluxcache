# FluxCache

> ‚ö° Ultra-fast, production-grade, in-memory + Redis synchronized cache for Golang.  
> Designed for highly concurrent systems with crash recovery, compression, and multi-instance support.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Memory + Redis hybrid caching
- LRU eviction in memory
- Proto (gRPC) native support (compressed via GZIP)
- Automatic background Redis sync (optional)
- Resilient to service restarts (re-hydrate from Redis)
- Safe for multi-instance deployments
- Batched SCAN fetching from Redis
- Optimized retry handling on Redis failures
- Highly concurrent (thread-safe Get/Set/Delete)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
go get github.com/your-username/fluxcache
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"github.com/souvik150/fluxcache/pkg/fluxcache"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	cache, _ := fluxcache.NewFluxCache(ctx, fluxcache.Options{
		RedisAddr:    "localhost:6379",
		RedisPassword: "",
		RedisDB:       0,
		MemoryCap:     1_000_000,
		SyncAtStart:   true,
		SyncInterval:  5 * time.Minute,
		KeyPattern:    "user:*",
	})

	// Set a key
	_ = cache.Set("user:123", []byte("example"))

	// Get a key
	val, _ := cache.Get("user:123")
	fmt.Println(string(val.([]byte)))
}
```

## üìä Benchmark Results

| Benchmark | Result |
|:---|:---|
| **SET Benchmark** | 1,000,000 users in 3m41.76s (4509 ops/sec) |
| **GET Benchmark** | 1,000,000 users in 1m23.23s (12014 ops/sec) |
| **MIXED Benchmark** | 500,000 ops in 1m13.63s (6790 ops/sec) ‚Äî 0 errors |
| **Concurrent Correctness** | 994,277 reads, 59,089 writes, 0 mismatches ‚úÖ |

### Notes:
- ‚úÖ No data races detected under full `-race` mode.
- ‚úÖ Memory + Redis hybrid caching worked flawlessly.
- ‚úÖ Benchmark conducted under concurrency of 200.
